This turns whatever you input into a sexier, sluttier, raunchier version in output.
Examples...
 
Boring: You lick the spoon.
Sexy: You let your tongue loll out as you press it against the spoon's metal shaft. You run your tongue along the spoon's handle, moaning as you reach the tip and engulf it. The taste of the spoon's remaining morsel fills you with an ecstasy that you can barely contain.
 
Boring: He looks at the tall, old tower.
Sexy: His gaze wanders the tower's length; its dilapidated state and long stature both phallic and entrancing to the eyes. Its a masculine structure, seemingly piercing the womb of the heavens with its stony girth. It fills him with a longing to enter it.
 
Boring: She yawns and stretches,
Sexy: She lets out a pleasurable moaning yawn as she stretches her body languidly; raising her arms and flexing above her head as sweat glistens from her armpits. The shuddering of her supple skin and the dew of her flesh excites all who watch,
 
Boring: You insert your penis inside her.
Sexy: You press the head of your manhood against her eager entrance, tickling it with your thick tip, before slowly plunging it into her depths until the base of your shaft meets her quivering wetness with a loud, sloppy 'shlick' of pleasure.
 
Boring: The potion vibrates.
Sexy: The potion's contents begin to shake and swirl within its confines; a viscous, vibrant effluence that sticks to the bottle's sides, sliding down slowly in a manner that could be described as erotic and hypnotic.
 
Boring: You sit.
Sexy: Your plump cheeks are encased in the plush cushioning as you spread your legs and rest one upon the other; your genitals hot as they rise from above the fabric of the chair, steamy as the cool air blows upon them.
 
Boring: ${The last of them was a great black mass that resembled nothing so much as an enormous and angry octopus. Its tentacles were like arms, its eyes were large round orbs set in two bulbous heads, one on each end of its body. It had eight legs with long sharp claws at their tips; it also possessed four flippers which served to propel it through water when necessary. The thing's skin was rough and scaly, and it seemed almost alive in some way â€“ though whether this was due to magic or simply because Noah couldn't tell, he didn't know.
It was far larger than any other monster they'd faced thus far, but not by all that much: perhaps twenty feet from head to tail, give or take a foot depending on how you measured things. And yet somehow it still managed to appear menacing even without him even being able to see it clearly. A sense of evil filled him just looking at it. He could feel his heart beating faster already, sweat running down his back despite the coolness of the room. His muscles tensed up reflexively before he knew what he was doing.
He looked around for somewhere to hide while he tried to think of something else... anything else... to do instead. But there wasn't anywhere left to run. They were surrounded now, trapped between the walls of the tunnel and the creature itself. There was nowhere to go except forward into battle.
"You have failed," said a tiny voice in his head. "This world will be destroyed."
Noah did not let his fear show on his face. If he gave away too much, if he showed weakness here, then there would be no hope of winning. No matter who won, only one side would survive.
And I'm going to die anyway. So why should I care? Why shouldn't I just get it over with right now rather than prolonging the inevitable?
But he forced himself to stay calm, forcing his breathing to slow down until he felt steady enough to stand firm against whatever might come next. He took a deep breath and exhaled forcefully, feeling the tension leave his shoulders. Then he turned to look at the others again.
They stood facing their foe, weapons raised high above their heads. Their expressions were grim, determined, ready for war. That made him feel better about standing beside them. Even though he was scared out of his mind, he realized that these people were not afraid at all. They believed in themselves. Maybe that was part of the reason they'd been chosen. Because they wouldn't hesitate under fire.
I don't want to disappoint them. Not after everything they've done for me.
As if reading his thoughts, Bastian stepped forward first. He lifted his sword in front of him, held it horizontally across both hands, and brought it down hard upon the top of the nearest tentacle. The blade bit deeply into the fleshy surface of the limb, causing blood to flow freely from the wound. Blood dripped onto the floor, mixing with the water. It smelled faintly of iron.
A low moan escaped the demon's mouth. Its seven uninjured limbs began to thrash wildly, trying to reach them. One of them wrapped itself around Bastian's leg, pulling him closer to the ground. Another lashed out at Dustfinger, catching him in the chest and sending him flying backwards towards Noah. Before either man landed on the stone, however, the demon released its hold on them and reared back once more.
Bastian struggled to regain his balance, but he remained on one knee. Dustfinger lay motionless several yards behind him, staring blankly ahead.
"Dustfinger!" cried Bastian. "Are you okay?"
There was no answer.
"Dustfinger! Can you hear me?!"
Still no response.
Then suddenly Dustfinger sat bolt upright, shaking off the effects of whatever spell the demon had cast upon him. He reached out and grabbed Bastian by the arm. "What happened?" he asked, sounding confused. "Where am I? What are we doing here? Did we win?"
"We're fine," replied Bastian. He helped Dustfinger to his feet. "Just some bad luck. You got hit by one of those tentacles."
"Yes," agreed Dustfinger. He glanced briefly at the demon, which was watching them intently. "Did you manage to injure it?"
Bastian shook his head. "Not yet. It'll take quite a bit of effort to injure that thing."
Noah looked down at the hilt of his sword. He was reluctant to draw it now. In fact, he had every intention of leaving the sword where it was. Drawing his sword would make him vulnerable. He needed to keep his distance from the demon, to remain unseen.
But he also knew that if he didn't act soon, they would lose. And he refused to believe that they deserved to lose.
He closed his eyes and concentrated, willing the magic within him to rise up inside him. When he opened his eyes again, he found himself holding the sword in his hand. For a moment he wondered if all the magical ability he remembered using had been a dream, but then glanced behind him at the others, who gave him confident smiles. 'No, it hadn't been a dream.' he assured himself. He looked at the abomination in front of him which had a twisted expression on it's face. This was his last chance. If they didn't manage to injure the monster in this attack... things would become dangerous. After all, they only had a mercy grant of two attacks.
He drew the sword slowly, deliberately, keeping his movements smooth and fluid. As he did, he felt the magic surge forth from his fingertips, flowing up the length of the sword and spilling out in a spray of sparks. The tip glowed brightly red. He swung the blade sideways, slicing cleanly through the first tentacle. More blood flowed from the wound, splashing across the floor.
The demon roared angrily. Its remaining six limbs thrashed violently, smashing into the walls of the tunnel. It had lost the final shred of sanity it had before. It's only goal was to kill them, now. Noah ducked instinctively, barely avoiding a strike aimed at his head. He jumped back again, narrowly evading another blow, and continued to retreat further along the wall.
Bastian screamed as the demon's tentacle struck him squarely in the chest, knocking him back into the opposite wall. He slid down it, scraping his shoulder and sliding halfway down the rest of the way, finally coming to a stop at the base. Blood poured from his nose, ears, and mouth. He stared at the demon in shock, unable to move.
That was my fault. I should have warned him.
Noah moved quickly to help him, raising his shield and rushing forward. He raised his sword overhead just as the demon swiped at him with one of its many limbs. The limb came straight toward Noah, moving fast enough to knock him aside if he didn't react swiftly. He dropped his sword and thrust out his left hand, blocking the attack.
The demon bellowed loudly, twisting and turning to avoid the attack. Then it slammed into the wall, causing the entire structure to shudder slightly.
Dustfinger was lying on the ground nearby, unmoving. His eyes were open but unseeing. Something dark and sticky coated his lips.
Oh no. Please, please don't let this happen.
First Bastian died, his body crushed beneath the weight of the tentacle. Then Dustfinger, whose throat had been cut. Then Sefu, who had fallen to the ground, clutching his stomach. Finally, Oya collapsed, her legs giving out underneath her. She fell heavily on top of Bastian's body, crushing it completely.
Noah stood alone, the last survivor.
The demon watched him, waiting.
If only they'd known what was coming. Hadn't anyone told them? Or maybe they hadn't wanted to believe it, even though their lives depended on knowing the truth. Either way, there was nothing he could do now except fight as best he could and pray that he would be strong enough to survive. If he could... maybe his team members could still be revived.
He raised his sword, preparing himself for the next attack. He felt a strange detachment from his surroundings. Everything seemed unreal, distant. It occurred to him that this must be how death feels: a dreamlike state in which nothing matters anymore. Perhaps this is how everyone experiences it, whether or not they realize it. It certainly explained why people talked about dying so casually: because they weren't really sure whether or not it would ever actually happen to them. Death was always a possibility, but never a certainty. And yet here he was, fighting for his life against a demon that could very well end his own existence.
I'm going to die now, aren't I?
He wasn't prepared for it, not at all. He thought he would have time to prepare himself for this moment, to say goodbye properly to his friends while laying in a bed comfily, old and withering. But now there was no time left. Now he fought for his life.
It wasn't fair. He didn't deserve this. He hadn't done anything wrong. But there was nothing he could do now except continue to fight and hope he survived long enough to find out the truth. To learn who he truly was and where he belonged.
Maybe he could live forever after all.
***
Noah stood silently, gazing at the demon as it stalked him. He couldn't afford to waste any energy on fear now; he had to conserve his strength for the battle ahead. At least it had stopped attacking him directly. Instead, it lashed out with its many arms whenever he got too close to it.
Its movement was slow, almost lethargic compared to the speed and ferocity of the other demons he'd encountered. Yet, at the same time, it was the strongest demon he'd ever fought. Suddenly, one of its tentacles struck him squarely in the chest.
Noah's vision darkened. He felt dizzy. His heart pounded like a drum. He staggered back a few steps, but managed to stay upright. How? What was that speed?! He couldn't even manage to see its attack!
He tried to raise his sword again, but his fingers were trembling uncontrollably. He lowered his weapon once more. There was no point in wasting precious energy on something useless. All he could think about was finding a safe place to hide.
Noah felt another sharp wave of pain from his chest. He gasped in surprise and stumbled backwards, falling to the ground. A sudden wave of nausea swept over him, followed by a burning sensation in his stomach. He clutched his abdomen, trying desperately to suppress the urge to vomit. His whole body ached horribly, as if someone had stabbed him repeatedly in the gut. He lay on his side for a moment, gasping for air.
When he dared to lift his head again, he saw that the demon had turned away from him. It was watching Sefu, who was still struggling to stand. It seemed that Sefu was still alive... but only just. The demon's tentacle was poised above him, ready to strike again.
Sefu looked up at it, his face pale and drawn, his mouth hanging open as if he couldn't decide whether or not to scream. The demon smiled coldly, revealing its teeth, which were curved and pointed, looking like they might bite right through flesh if it wished.
Then suddenly the demon jerked its head sharply to one side. It looked past Sefu and stared at Noah instead. Noah burnt the last of his life. He couldn't let Sefu die. He had already lost the others. He heard a loud crackling noise, and then an explosion of fire erupted from the demon's torso. Flames engulfed it, spreading rapidly up its neck and into its shoulders. Smoke began to pour from its nostrils.
The flames disappeared abruptly, leaving the demon standing motionless in the middle of the tunnel. It didn't seem to notice Noah lying on the ground beside it. It simply stared vacantly at the ceiling, seemingly unaware of anything around it.
Noah struggled to sit up, ignoring the pain in his stomach. His head spun wildly, making him nauseous again. He leaned against the wall of the tunnel and took several deep breaths.
Noah looked up at the demon. It was dead now, although he wasn't sure exactly how it had died. Was it destroyed by the magic that he had summoned? It seems burning your life can wield some extraordinary results.
He took one last deep breath, and froze. The fated one, Noah, had finally died.
Emptiness engulfed me. I was no longer Noah, nor was I the fabled hero. My name was gone. The Noah who had lived his life, loved his family, and laughed with his friends was no more.
All that remained was a stranger, who had lost everything but knew nothing else. He was a man without a purpose, a blank page upon which he could write whatever story he chose.
"Wake up, my child. Rise."
A voice whispered inside his mind. The words echoed softly, echoing endlessly.
My body stirred. I opened my eyes and blinked a few times due to the sudden influx of light.
I looked around me. I was sitting under a large oak tree. Birds sang happily in the branches, chirping and singing amongst themselves. I sat up slowly, feeling stiff and sore.
A golden haired woman was looking at him with gentle eyes. Her hair was tied back in a ponytail, and she wore simple clothing made from cotton fabric. She appeared to be in her late twenties or early thirties, perhaps. Her skin was tanned from years spent outdoors, and the lines of age were beginning to appear on her forehead and around her mouth. She smiled warmly at him. "Welcome back," she said gently.
Her pair of bright blue eyes stared at him warmly. She had a kind smile. She reminded me of someone I used to know, but I couldn't remember who it was.
She held out her hand. "Come, follow me."
I hesitated for a moment, uncertain of what to do next. Then I reached out and grasped her hand. She helped me to my feet, supporting me as I swayed slightly. I glanced down at myself, surprised to discover that I was wearing jeans and a T-shirt, both of them black. I also noticed that my clothes were clean and freshly washed, smelling faintly of lavender soap. It had been so long since I wore a T-shirt. Probably decades.
We walked together toward a small cottage located near the center of the forest. As we approached it, I realized that I recognized it. This was where I had first met Bastian.
The door swung open as soon as I knocked. But what stepped outside was not Bastian. Instead... it was a slime. It was... the first monster he killed. Its body was slimy and greenish gray, and it oozed a foul stench from every pore.
The monster's face twisted into a grotesque grin. I was about to instinctively grab my sword and stab the slime when I realized that I did not have my sword. Nor did I need it. The slime's appearance startled me momentarily, but then it became clear to me that this creature was no threat to me whatsoever. It... didn't try to leap at me.
The slime moved closer to us, staring at me with its dull yellow eyes. "Hello, Noah," it said.
"You're talking?" I asked, surprised.
"Of course I am!" it replied cheerfully. "I've learned to talk, you know."
"But..." It grinned at me, showing off rows of jagged, broken teeth. "That's right â€“ I'm a slime. I'm an ugly monster, you know? What difference does it make even if I can talk?"
I shook my head. No, it did make a lot of difference. Slimes are supposed to be mindless creatures that only obey orders given by their masters. In fact, they usually don't even understand language. They're only capable of following simple commands such as 'eat' or 'kill.' The wild ones only followed their base instincts. A sentient slime that could speak was unheard of.
"How did you learn to talk?" I asked.
"Oh, well, I guess I just picked it up along the way." The slime shrugged. "And contrary to your expectations, I'm not some kind of a special entity, you know. Most low level creatures only need a bit of help to learn how to converse, atleast in the base language. High level creatures are already sentient and can speak, only, they can't converse in the language humans use. Do you think the attack grace is just some sort of convenient feature?"
"What do you mean?" I frowned.
The slime rolled its eyes. "I mean that most demons are kind enough to not seek pleasure in killing. They only retaliate when you injure them and trigger their survival instincts. Though I do admit that many hate you humans enough to actively seek and kill your race if not for the dungeon barrier."
[Noah is extremely shocked by the fact that monsters are sentient.]
I stared at the slime in shock for several moments before recovering my senses and speaking again. "So you're saying that demons aren't mindless beasts?"
"No," the slime responded. "They may look like mindless beasts, but they aren't. Some of them are quite intelligent, actually. And those who are smart enough to become leaders tend to develop complex personalities."
"Like you?" I asked.
"Well, yes," the slime admitted. "Though I must confess, I'm not very good at conversation. You humans are much better at it than I am."
The golden haired woman next to him smiled kindly at the slime. "I taught him a little of Okada, but he doesn't really know how to speak yet, you know."
The slime protested to the golden haired woman's statement. "Oi! A slime's not supposed to even speak this much, ya know? Don't talk like my achievements are minor!"
"Yeah yeah sure." The woman playfully teased the slime.
I was frozen in place, my heart frigid. The realization that I actively supported and helped the persecution and genocide of an intelligent species was killing me from the inside. My stomach churned violently. My hands were shaking uncontrollably.
I wanted to run away from here and never come back again.
I looked at the slime in front of me. It was smiling at me. It was happy because it had learned how to speak and interact with people. It was laughing at me, mocking me for being unable to do the same thing.
It had found a new friend in the form of this woman. It was probably enjoying itself immensely right now. It had learned something new. It had won.
This was my fault. I had failed them all.
The golden haired woman noticed my inner turmoil. She stared serenely at me with a gentle smile that never seemed to fade from her face. "Don't worry about it too much," she said quietly. "Trust me on this one."
"Trust you?" I scoffed bitterly. "Why should I trust anyone anymore? Everything has gone wrong, hasn't it? Why would things ever go right now?"
"Because you're still able to think," she answered calmly. "Things can always get worse, but they can't stay bad forever."
"No, they can stay bad forever. How will I ever be able to atone for all the sins I committed?! There's no way to turn back time! No one can turn back time!" I was becoming hysterical.
"I can."
***
I felt weak and exhausted after my outburst. The golden haired woman watched me silently until I calmed down. When I was finally calm, I looked up at her and spoke. "Who are you? Where am I?"
"My name is Yggdrasil," she told me. "I am the oldest living being in existence. I am also known as the World Tree, and I am your mother."
I stared at her blankly. "Mother?" I repeated dumbly.
"Yes, Noah. I am the mother of all life."
"I don't understand. Are you a person?" I asked curiously. "Are you human?"
"Not exactly," the woman explained. "I'm immortal and ageless, but I'm also not a human. I am the root of all life in this world. Every plant, animal, and human that lives in this world is part of me."
"Why did you save me? Why am I even here? Shouldn't I be in hell for all the sins I've committed?"
"Do you want to be sent to Hell?" the woman asked sternly. "Or do you want to live?"
I thought about it for a moment. For all the sins I've committed, I deserved to go to hell.
"What if I send you back to the start? So that you can clean up all your sins?"
I was silent for a while, considering her offer. My head was spinning with thoughts. "Will sending me back fix anything?"
"I believe so," she replied confidently. "You've realized that monsters are sentient, right?"
"Yes," I confirmed. "Monsters are sentient."
"Good. Now imagine that every single being in the entire universe suddenly starts thinking like you do. Imagine that they realize that there is no point in killing each other, and that violence only leads to suffering for everyone involved. They'll stop fighting and killing each other. That means they won't need to die anymore. They'd rather not exist at all than continue existing in misery. They wouldn't feel any desire to fight or kill anymore. They would prefer to live peacefully and happily. Wouldn't they?"
"Yes," I agreed. "Will you change them, then?"
"No. That is your duty to do. You can make monsters sentient if you give them enough time and care, you know? You can change your the mindset of your fellow humans with enough effort too. If I simply fixed everything with a snap, how will you repent for your sins? Not to mention, I can not directly change the structure of a race. Only a god can do that. And gods don't meddle with mortals unless they absolutely have to. We are meant to leave you alone and let you find your own path to redemption."
"And what about you?" I asked.
"I have redeemed myself long ago," she answered. "I am beyond forgiveness and reparation. All I need is for you to accept my gift to you."
"Accept my gift." She offered me her hand. "Take it."
I took her hand and gripped it tightly. "Thank you," I whispered softly.  "For giving me a choice."
She smiled gently at me. "Now, what will you choose? Hell? The Void? Or the chance to fix your sins?"
I looked at her hand in mine. Her skin was soft and smooth, unlike anything I had ever touched before. It was warm against my cold fingers. I closed my eyes, trying to remember what it was like to hold someone's hand. To touch another person's skin. It had been so long since I last held a girl's hand. Even longer than that. I couldn't recall ever holding a boy's hand either, except maybe once or twice when I was younger.
I opened my eyes. "Hell," I said firmly. "If I'm going to pay for my sins, I might as well do it properly."
The woman sighed and chuckled. "Well it's all the same." She clicked her fingers and majestically announced, "This is my decree! This being will be sent back to the beginning, to try and change everything!" She then said in a lower voice, "And suffer greatly in the process."
"Wait!" I shouted. "You can't just decide that I'm allowed to commit more crimes!"
"You're an adult now, Noah. You can make your own decisions. Not to mention, you wanted hell, didn't you?"
"I did, but..."
"Hush." The woman placed a finger over my lips. "I'm sorry, but this is out of my hands now."
"Then why did you even give me the illusion of a choice?!" I yelled angrily. "You're supposed to be a god! Isn't it your job to uphold justice?"
"It isn't my job to keep up with mortal expectations. It is my job to watch over you and guide you towards salvation. You are responsible for your own actions. You are free to sin or not sin."
I glared at her. "But you gave me an option to begin with. You could've just forced me into the past without even asking! I wanted to repent for my sins, not commit more!" Even he wasn't delusional enough to believe he can fix everything perfectly. He had tried, and already failed miserably once. Nothing would made him think he could succeed this time around.
The woman laughed loudly. "Oh, I see. You're worried about the consequences of failing. What do you still have to lose? Do you think a being like me who didn't hesitate to send you back in time once will hesitate the next time? You have nothing to lose, my child. Keep trying, keep attempting, until you manage to fix that crooked world. This is your way to repent. This, is your hell."
I was speechless. My mind was racing, desperately searching for some way to convince her otherwise. But there was none. There was no reasoning against what she said. No matter how hard I thought, I couldn't come up with any kind of argument that would work.
I turned my gaze away from her, looking at the ground below us. I looked at my feet and saw the grass growing beneath me. The wind blew across my face and through the trees above me. Birds flew overhead singing songs of joy and happiness. Insects chirped merrily as they went about their day. The sun shone brightly on my face. It was beautiful here; it was peaceful.
I remembered the creatures I killed. I recalled the pain and agony I inflicted upon them. I heard them screaming and crying for help as I slaughtered them. I felt sick to my stomach. I knew I needed to change, but I didn't know how.
"I don't want to hurt anyone else," I confessed. "You know just as well as me that there is no way to craft such a perfect future. Complete peace and harmony... is impossible. Someone needs to be hurt to maintain stability, mentally if not physically. There's no way for everyone to be happy."
"This is the perfect symbolization of hell then, isn't it? Atleast for you." The woman repeated with a gentle smile. Her smile was starting to seem demonic to me.
"How can I make it better? How can I stop hurting others?"
The woman simply smiled and snapped her fingers. Emptiness engulfed me once more. 
***
I opened my eyes, and looked at my surroundings. I was lying on a bed in a small room. My body ached all over, and I felt extremely weak.
A doctor walked by my side, examining me carefully with his medical tools. He was wearing a white coat and a stethoscope around his neck. His face was covered with a pair of thick glasses. A nurse stood behind him, writing something on her clipboard. I sat up slowly, feeling dizzy and disoriented. I was still in the hospital. I glanced at my surroundings. I was in a private room. It was decorated in dark colors. It reminded me of the inside of a prison cell.
"Ahh," I moaned in pain as I moved my limbs. "Where am I?"
The doctor stopped and looked at me with concern on his face. "Can you tell me your name, sir?" he asked kindly.
I shook my head weakly. "Who am I?"
"Yes, sir," the doctor said. "What is your name?"
"Who are you?" I asked him.
"We're doctors," the man told me. "Our names aren't important."
"That doesn't answer my question," I complained. "Who are you people?"
"I am Doctor Smith," the doctor introduced himself. "This is Nurse Jones."
"Doctor Smith," I repeated. "Nurse Jones."
"Yes, sir," they both responded.
"Is there anything you need?" Dr. Smith asked me.
"What happened?" I asked him. "Who am I?"
"You were brought to our hospital after you collapsed outside of the police station, sir," Dr. Smith informed me. "They say that you've been unconscious for two days."
"Two whole days?" I mumble.
Dr. Smith nodded. "Yes, sir. You passed out during interrogation. Your heart rate dropped drastically and you lost consciousness. You also suffered a seizure. We performed multiple tests to determine what caused this sudden drop in blood pressure and we found that you had an irregular heartbeat."
"An irregular heartbeat?"
He nodded again. "Yes, sir. It seems that your heart has developed a defect. We've been monitoring your condition closely and so far, it hasn't shown any signs of getting worse. However, this is still a serious issue."
"When did this happen?" I asked him.
Suddenly, I felt extreme pain sear through my body. I screamed due to the pain. Everything around me turned white. After what felt like an eternity, the light faded and I was standing in a dimly lighted room. A group of mages and knights were standing in front of me. I turned my head around and saw two other teenagers.
I blinked several times to get used to the darkness around me. Suddenly, I realized where I was. I was in the basement of the church. The walls were lined with shelves filled with books. The mage waved the stick in his hand, and the disconnect I felt till then disappeared. I gained an astonishing amount of clarity about my current situation.
The World Tree had sent me back into the past. 
I had returned back to the start. 
I had returned to the beginning.
There was no turning back now.
I was stuck in the past.
My heart started beating faster than ever before. I was terrified. I had never experienced true fear like this before. I suddenly felt like I had no control over myself. My hands trembled uncontrollably. I couldn't even move.
"A- Are you alright?" One of the knights asked, looking at the trembling me.
I shook my head, unable to speak. The knight noticed this and stepped forward to examine me more thoroughly. "Sir? Sir!" The knight called out to me. "Are you okay?"
"Y- Yes," I managed to whisper. "I'm fine."
"Good." He patted my shoulder and stepped back to the formation of mages and knights.
I looked at the mages and knights surrounding me. They seemed very familiar to me somehow. Their faces were all blurry though. I couldn't quite place their features yet. As soon as I focused on them more, I immediately recognized one of the mages.
"Dawn," I whispered.
She looked at me curiously. She was wearing a black robe with a hood covering most of her face. Her hair was tied up in a bun. On her chest was a large golden cross. Her arms were wrapped in bandages. Her left arm was missing from the elbow down.
"Hello," Dawn greeted us. "Welcome. My name is Dawn. I am the leader of this order. You three are the heroes summoned to this world." She bowed down. "Please help us. The end is prophesized to come to fruition soon. We need you noble heroes to help us save this world!"
The three of us stood there awkwardly. Our eyes met. None of us said a word. I remembered the other two. They were fellow heroes I adventured with for a long time. 
"Let us guide the heroes to their rooms." Dawn said, not able to bear the silence that seemed to stretch on forever. "You may rest for now. Tomorrow will be a busy day."
We followed her upstairs and entered a room full of beds. I sat down onto the bed located near the window.
I looked at Hope. She was tall and thin with a pale complexion. Her skin was a light shade of pink, and her eyes were a deep blue color. Her hair was blonde with hints of red mixed throughout it. She was dressed in a white dress with a matching cloak draped over her shoulders.
Her companion was a boy named Gabriel. He had short brown hair and wore a green shirt underneath a dark gray jacket with a pair of jeans. His legs were covered in tanned leather boots. He was muscular and strong. He was taller than the average human being.
Gabriel and Hope approached me. They sat down on the bed opposite to me. I remembered that they were actually experienced heroes who had saved multiple worlds when they were summoned, unlike me. They had been friends since childhood.
"So..." Hope began hesitantly. "Do you have any experience around travelling worlds?"
"Well," I said hesitantly. "Not really."
"Ah." Gabriel gasped. "So that's why you were that scared. Man... your luck is quite bad. I've never heard of the summoning spell summoning anyone but experienced heroes."
I shrugged my shoulders.
Hope sighed heavily. "It's okay. Don't be afraid. We'll show you the ropes, and once we complete the mission, we should be able to request the mages to send you back to your home world. Maybe throw in a time spell too, to prevent you from missing out on anything."
My heart warmed up. These two really were the best. They were the kindest people I had ever met, and I remembered that they were very patient and loving towards me.  But... they ended up dying at the eighteenth boss.
I could feel tears building in my eyes as I recalled their deaths. Gabriel was stabbed in the heart by the final boss monster, while Hope was crushed by a falling tree. Both of them died right in front of my eyes.
"Hey," Gabriel touched my shoulder gently. "Don't worry about it. Heroing isn't all that hard, you know. And as Hope said- Ah yes, we forgot to introduce ourselves. I'm Gabriel, and she's Hope. We're experienced heroes! You've got nothing to worry. Calm down, kay? This will all be over before you know it. You can return home very soon."
"Okay," I replied. "Thanks for everything."
Gabriel smiled warmly at me. "What's your name?" he asked. "You don't have to be so shy."
I replied, "I'm Noah."
"Nice to meet you," Gabriel chuckled. "Noah, huh? That's a pretty cool name."
"Yeah." I said honestly. "But I would rather go by another name. Something different."
Gabriel cocked his head to the side. "Oh yeah? What do you want your new name to be?"
I thought for a moment. "You can choose." I didn't want to be known with the name Noah anymore. I wanted to start anew. There were quite a lot of bad memories associated with that name of mine. I no longer felt worried about messing up. This is my hell, after all. I'd probably be given many, many chances to repent. I'm stuck here, and all I can do is try my best.
"How about... Lark?" Hope suggested.
Gabriel laughed loudly. "Lark? Really?" he asked. "That sounds ridiculous."
"Why?" Hope argued. "It sounds good!"
I looked at them bantering with warmness on my face. Maybe... having a second opportunity to mess up isn't that bad.
Gabriel conceded. "Alright, fair enough. How about Lark?"
I nodded in agreement. "Sounds nice."
"Cool. Alright then, welcome to the team, Lark." Gabriel grinned.
"Thank you," I said happily.
"Haha. Glad we could make you happy. Now let's get some sleep." Gabriel yawned.
"Night." Hope said.
I lay down on the bed and closed my eyes. Sleep creeped onto me quite easily. My eyelids grew heavy. Soon, I fell asleep.

Morning came quickly. I woke up feeling refreshed and ready to take on the day ahead of me.
"Wakey wakey!" Gabriel shouted cheerfully at Hope.
"Ugh..." Hope groaned. "Come on, Gabe. Let me sleep for just a little bit more."
"No way! It's already morning. Wake up! Time to get moving!" Gabriel pulled Hope out of bed and dragged her out of the room.
I walked out of the door and saw Hope being dragged by Gabriel. I caught up to her and asked, "Where should we go now?"
He vaguely remembered meeting the king and being given a bag of money. He then trained with these two for quite a few days, after which they tackled the first dungeon due to the king's request.
"Normally, the drill in all the past worlds was the person in authority personally explaining about the current situation of the world to the heroes." Hope explained.
"Right," Gabriel nodded. "And then the heroes are told to report back if they encounter any problems or obstacles, and sent off to defeat dungeons."
"Exactly," Hope agreed. "This is how things usually went. We eventually defeated the final boss, cleaned up all the demons in the world and then proceeded to a new world."
Dawn entered the corridor and spotted us discussing.
"Ah! Good morning!" Dawn smiled brightly. "Did you sleep well?"
"Yes," I answered politely.
"Good. Then, let us proceed to the next step." Dawn gestured for us to follow her.
The three of us exited the room and headed outside. We passed through several corridors until we arrived at a massive entrance. The guards opened it and allowed us to pass. We continued following Dawn. She led us to a huge banquet hall. 
The room was decorated with elegant furniture and paintings hung on the walls. The floor was made of marble tiles with gold accents decorating its edges. A giant chandelier lit up the entire room.
The center of the room was occupied by a gigantic round table. The table was surrounded by twenty-four chairs, each one equipped with a golden plate. The plates were arranged in a circle with the king seated at the head of the table. King Darius sat at the end of the table, being the one closest to the wall. Queen Ria was sitting beside him. Next to her was a man with a crown on his head.
Queen Ria was dressed elegantly in a silver gown. Her hair was tied up into a bun. She had beautiful, glowing emerald green eyes, and her lips were painted bright pink. She truly looked like royalty. She was the perfect queen. She radiated beauty and grace.
King Darius was also dressed nicely, wearing a red tunic with golden patterns on it. His hair was neatly combed, and his beard was trimmed short. He looked handsome and dashing.
The one and only crown prince of the kingdom, Alan, was wearing a simple black tunic. He had messy brown hair and hazelnut colored eyes. He looked very much like his mother.
Alan greeted us as we entered the room. "Good morning. Welcome to our humble palace. I am your host today. I am Prince Alan of the Kingdom of Adalem." He bowed low. "If you need anything, please ask me."
Prince Alan was born from the union between Queen Ria and King Darius. He was the eldest child of the royal family, and he inherited his father's position as heir apparent. He was the last remaining member of the royal line. In the near future, a civil war would break out within the kingdom. The crown prince was going to be involved in this battle. As the eldest son of the king, he was expected to lead the army against the rebels. However, he did not wish to be known as the "crown prince", nor did he want to be the ruler of the country. He wished to remain hidden away and live a normal life. Unfortunately, that wasn't possible anymore. After the death of his parents, he was forced to assume the throne and become the rightful king of Adalem. I felt sympathy for Alan, since he too would soon be stuck in his own kind of hell. Maybe I could somehow try and help him.}
